# TACTEC Marketing Site UI/UX Audit

## Approach
- Reviewed the primary marketing landing page component, global navigation, language switcher, contact form, and privacy policy layouts defined in the Next.js codebase.
- Focused on visual hierarchy, content strategy, interaction design, accessibility, localisation, and conversion flow support for prospects evaluating the platform.

## Strengths
- **Clear hero story and immediate calls-to-action.** The landing page hero establishes hierarchy with a bold headline, supporting copy, and dual CTAs that adapt responsively, helping visitors understand the product value quickly.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L145-L188】
- **Consistent visual theming across sections.** Alternating background tones, elevated imagery, and footer structure create a cohesive, professional feel that fits an enterprise SaaS offering.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L195-L354】
- **Robust contact workflow with validation.** The contact page uses schema-based validation and status feedback, reducing submission errors and communicating processing state to the user.【F:src/pages/contact.tsx†L13-L144】【F:src/pages/contact.tsx†L204-L372】
- **Language switcher includes accessibility affordances.** The component provides aria attributes, escape handling, and desktop/mobile variants, making locale changes usable across devices.【F:src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx†L6-L142】

## Key Issues & Recommendations
1. **Navigation lacks a skip link and focus management for the mobile menu.** While the main content region is focusable, there is no skip-to-content trigger and the mobile drawer does not trap focus, increasing effort for keyboard users.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L82-L141】  
   _Recommendation:_ Add a visually hidden skip link that targets `#content`, focus lock, and inert body scrolling when the menu is open.
2. **Hero and footer navigation omit high-intent destinations like product modules or case studies.** The CTA links route only to the contact page or feature anchors without supporting content, limiting mid-funnel exploration.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L160-L299】  
   _Recommendation:_ Introduce secondary links (e.g., platform tour, customer stories) and ensure anchors lead to sections with substantive detail.
3. **Feature, solution, and technology sections contain only text blocks.** Without bullet summaries, iconography, or screenshots, the scannability and perceived depth of the offering suffer.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L240-L283】  
   _Recommendation:_ Add card grids highlighting differentiators, include imagery or animation, and link to deeper resources.
4. **Contact form feedback is not announced to assistive tech.** Status messages render visually but lack aria-live regions, and inputs omit `autoComplete` hints, creating friction for screen readers and mobile browsers.【F:src/pages/contact.tsx†L204-L337】  
   _Recommendation:_ Wrap status text in a `role="status"` or `aria-live` region and add semantic attributes like `autoComplete="name"`, `autoComplete="organization"`, etc.
5. **Privacy policy “Last Updated” value is generated at runtime.** Rendering the current date without source-of-truth metadata may mislead users about policy freshness.【F:src/pages/privacy.tsx†L45-L64】  
   _Recommendation:_ Store the revision date in content and display it explicitly when updates occur.
6. **Language menu lists eight locales without exposing translation coverage context.** Users cannot preview which pages are translated or default fallbacks, potentially causing confusion if some locales are partial.【F:src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx†L6-L140】  
   _Recommendation:_ Surface a tooltip or subtext clarifying beta/localised coverage, and persist the last selected locale via cookies or profile data.

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)
- Implement skip navigation and focus locking for the mobile menu to meet WCAG 2.1 keyboard accessibility expectations.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L82-L141】
- Add aria-live announcements and browser auto-complete hints to the contact form to streamline submissions.【F:src/pages/contact.tsx†L204-L337】
- Replace placeholder feature sections with a concise grid (copy + icon) to improve scannability and SEO relevance.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L240-L283】

## Strategic Enhancements
- Develop dedicated subpages or modal demos for core modules so the hero CTA can branch to both discovery and conversion paths, reducing immediate bounce to the contact form.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L160-L299】
- Introduce social proof, such as case studies or testimonial sliders, between challenge and solution sections to reinforce credibility before the CTA.【F:src/components/TacTecLanding.tsx†L195-L303】
- Expand locale handling to remember user preference and communicate translation status, supporting the global audience signalled by the language list.【F:src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx†L6-L140】
